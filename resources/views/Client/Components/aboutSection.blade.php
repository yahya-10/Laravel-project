                <p>
                    As you have decided to take a look at my website, I bet you’re now wondering who I am, 
                    what my story is and how I came to be. Well, you’d be correct in thinking that I am first and foremost a chef. 
                    I specialise in promoting mindful eating and focusing on developing nutritious and tasty recipes that are gluten-free,  
                </p>
                <p>
                    low in dairy and contain no refined sugars. But there is a whole lot more meaning to my work besides fancy words and appetizing recipes. 
                    For me, food is like a love affair. My mind will often wonder what type of eggs I’m going to cook for breakfast and how I am going to roast my potatoes for dinner. 
                    I find utter joy in experimenting and conjuring up new ways to make delicious food whilst 
                    always maintaining my passion for health and nutrition right at the heart of it.
